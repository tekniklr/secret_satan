This script will parse the provided array of persons to generate a
one to one relationship between them, suitable for gift giving. It will 
email each person with their 'victim' and any rules for the gifting 
occasion (price ranges, etc.). The person who runs the program will have 
no idea what associations are made, unless they cheat and look at their 
sendmail logs.

The participants are programmed into a configurable array of hashes before
the program is run. Each hash has an option to contain an additional array
of excluded users for each person- either people that participant doesn't 
know, people that they are already purchasing a gift for outside of this 
event, or people who exchanged gifts though a similar roulette the 
previous year.
